I am a full-stack web developer and designer born in 1986 and based in Lisbon, Portugal.
Graduated from Le Wagon - the worldâ€™s leading web development bootcamp - with a
comprehensive set of technical skills that prepared me to make it as a fierce developer.
Over a decade of architecture experience, I increased my creativity, eagerness to learn and
organisational skills and I wish to pair those strengths with this newly acquired knowledge by
doing some exciting work in a professional and challenging environment.
